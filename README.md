# Gatsby-Notebook

Inspired by [Apollo docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/). A personal theme notebook using Gatsby.

This is my attempt to use Gatsby to make a personal notebooks (for secrets and such). Yes I can use google docs or something else, but there is something about making your own that makes it sweeter to use. Plus it gives me a chance to learn about Gatsby and practice react hooks.
